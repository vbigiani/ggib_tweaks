These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck~

From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gack ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a dub ass C thang dub C brain
And we don't kick it but bust it and kaki jeans strains
I'm done movin I'm clearin the crowd
It's the who bangin bandana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal
The ori-gi-nal

Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you plain homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane
And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us partna, dealers and drug runners
And Mack need a ? in a H2 Hummer
Lookin hotter than the South Central L.A. summer
Let's go~

With a flock of pros on us cause the cronic is ??
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation

It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the b in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't bow like me
Cause I'm really from the gang ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin up and comin young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin for the hood causin havic and ruckus
You fools actin label kissin up like suckas
And your trick solder down when you pee lil bustas

[Ice Cube]
One thing I do know I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno (you know)
I'd like to thank the congregation 
In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation

You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it

[Mack 10]
