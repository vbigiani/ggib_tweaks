Mang0's Hip-Hop Mod v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod brings a whole new hip-hop feel to Baldur's Gate II. Throne of Bhaal is required. The changes are as follows:

- Irenicus, Bodhi, the Five and Mellissan are renamed to Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren and Eazy-E. Unfortunately, there are more than four bosses, so some of the names are re-used.
- The stone heads at the start of ToB now recite the lyrics of Gangsta Nation by Westside Connection.
- Crossbow are now renamed to Gats, and Bolts to Hollow Points.
- The Thumb is now 50 Cent.

Please write down all bug reports and shove them up your ass.
