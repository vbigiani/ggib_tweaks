Section 0: Warning
------------------
WARNING: This mod contains scenes of a sexually explicit nature, or which are
homophobic. If it is illegal for somebody of your age to use such materials, or
if you are easily offended, please UNINSTALL NOW the mod and delete all of its
contents. I will disregard any tentative of communicate your sense of disgust
to me.


Section I: Introduction
-----------------------
Once upon a time, Cromptoni released a mod called "The Circle Mod", which dealt
with men's frustrations. NiGHTMARE suggested that a mod be made to deal with
women's frustrations and lo, here is Square Mod made. Enjoy.

Also, there was request for crossmod content with Circle. I have been unable to
contact Cromptoni for authorization, so I had to settle with cross-sex material
instead for Triangle  :(

There was demand also for an Octagon mod, so here it comes.


Section II: Installation
------------------------
BGII is required, TOB should be optional. The Square Mod should work fine with
most other WeiDU mods.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-Squaremod.exe".

You may always uninstall this mod later by re-running "Setup-Squaremod.exe".

The Square mod will work correctly without starting a new game.

The components should install correctly for international players who have both
DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.
